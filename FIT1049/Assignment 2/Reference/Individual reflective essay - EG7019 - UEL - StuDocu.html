1 Individual Reflective Essay Communication for Global Business Henrique
Oliveira Altoe Word Count: 1716 Introduction: The purpose of this essay
is to reflect on how me and my team performed and collaborated with each
other in order to completed our group e portfolio. In this essay I will
be reflecting on events and situations which had an affect on our
performances and how our project was created and finished. This essay
will cover the team roles each of the team members were, what were their
functions and responsibilities and how our strengths and weaknesses
benefited the groups. The essay will also talk about of a which we
experienced when forming into the teams and when we had to delegate work
to each other based on qualities and flaws. Also the communications
methods we used between ourselves were very crucial on how efficiently
we got our points across and how we experience difficulties within the
team and how we managed to overcome these issues. Background: In class,
in the first few weeks, we carried out the Belbin Theory test which
helps determine what are an strengths and weaknesses and what type of
team members they are. A few of the different types of team members are
plant, team worker, shaper and resource investigator. In our group, we
had me and another group member as team workers, a shaper, a plant and a
resource investigator. We all felt that the team was well balanced and
we were happy with the outcome. As per Jane S. Prichard et Neville A.
team role theory is an effective way of developing a team, however there
is not much empirical support for his work, mainly because of the lack
of research. However, they still acknowledge the fact that it is used
many companies around the would to propose teams with a wide variety of
qualities. Even though this was the initial stage of us forming the
groups, we were already experiencing of a which at this stage was the
forming of team period. This includes getting into teams and at this
period in time, we were all excited and looking forward to work together
as a team. Within the first week, we had a member of the team leave, as
there was difficulties in meeting her whenever we attempted to organise
meetings. As a team, we felt we felt that she was not making as much
effort as the others, there had been numerous attempts to keep her in
the loop regarding the project, however we felt that she was not
prioritising the group work. As a team, after discussing also with the
seminar teacher, we decided to part ways with her as we all thought that
we would work better and more effectively without distractions and
preventing issues arising. 2 After that was finally resolved, we had
meetings and we were able to progress with the project delegating work
according to strengths. With the Belbin theory results coming into use,
we decided the work based on each results of the test. I was a team
worker, meaning I was able to collaborate with other with ease, able to
help with various tasks at the same time while trying to avoid problems
and confrontations between team members. I was in charge of carrying out
some research regarding customer service, the services they provide and
their social media accounts and how they use it. According to Kristina
Hauschildt et Udo Konradt (2012) the roles and performances of a team is
based on proficiency, adaptivity and projectivity. This was something we
all attempted to do as we had to adapt working with different
personalities and be productive in terms of starting the project and
carrying out work. While working in this project, we used commination
methods like face to face conversations, use of social media and mobile
phones. This was effective and efficient as it saved time and it was
also cost effective to everyone in the team. It was methods of
communication that we, student are very familiar as we use it on a daily
basis. It made it extremely easy and convenient for us to all get in
touch as we created a group on one of the social media platforms we
decided to use. doing that, we were able to talk and share pieces of
work that we each had researched and found. At this stage of the
process, according to of a we were at the norming stage, which means we
were in agreement as to what each other were responsible for doing, we
knew our roles and we were all on track to meet deadlines and targets.
The performing stage is where the team has a clear vision, a focus on
the goal and objective. This was where the team and I were clear on what
we wanted to achieve and what we wanted to end result to be. At this
stage however, another issue started to arise as one of the team members
started to get a bit distracted and disinterested in the project, which
surprised me and the rest of the team. I personally felt annoyed and
angry as we all thought that we had put problems behind us after we
faced a few at the beginning of the project, however, it worried and
caught all of us surprise. The reason why we all felt like that was
because one of the team members was being very difficultly to
communicate with, hard to collaborate and showing very little interest
in the entire project and the outcome of it. As soon as we realised that
the individual was completely not interested in helping us, we spoke to
the seminar tutor and explained everything to him. He wanted us to first
try to sort it out, we did but there was no resolve and it the end it
ended up being just 3 of us in the team, me team worker, a shaper and a
resource investigator. This was a very difficult and confusing time in
the process of completing our project as we enow each had to take on
more work load as were one only a team of 3 people, compared to 5 when
we first started. As per Serina Chiper (2015), dimensions in
intercultural communication in business schools has certain rules which
have to be followed in order to be efficient when communicating in a
team with people from various different backgrounds. It states that
individuals sometimes have to learn a bit more about a culture in order
to know how to communicate and act around them. This relates to the fact
that, me being from Brazil and working in a team with 2 eastern
Europeans, meaning that there were different customs on how we
approached tasks and problems. As this project was one of the first we
were set when our university course began, we were all fairly new to
each other and were still getting to know more and more about others.
Working towards the final stage of the process in regards to of a
adjourning, we finally completed the task and worked hard towards
getting good recognition for our work. In the last few weeks, the week
before last to be more exact, we 4 Reference List Costa, P.L et al

Individual Reflective Essay 
Communication for Global Business 
Henrique Oliveira Altoe 
Word Count: 1716 
Introduction: 
The purpose of this essay is to reflect on how me and my team performed and 
collaborated with each other in order to completed our group e portfolio. In this essay I will 
be reflecting on events and situations which had an affect on our performances  and how 
our project was created and finished. This essay will cover the team roles each of the team 
members were, what were their functions and responsibilities and how our teamâ€™s 
strengths and weaknesses benefited the groups. The essay will also talk about Tuckmanâ€™s 
â€˜Lifecycle of a teamâ€™ which we experienced when forming into the teams and when we had 
to delegate work to each other based on qualities and flaws. Also the communications 
methods we used between ourselves were very crucial on how efficiently we got our points 
across and how we experience difficulties within the team and how we managed to 
overcome these issues.  
Background: 
  
In class, in the first few weeks, we carried out the Belbin Theory test which helps 
determine what are an individualâ€™s strengths and weaknesses and what type of team 
members they are. A few of the different types of team members are plant, team worker, 
shaper and resource investigator.  
In our group, we had me  and another group member as team workers, a shaper, a plant 
and a resource investigator. We all felt that the team was well balanced and we were 
happy with the outcome.  As per Jane S. Prichard et Neville A. (1999), Belbinâ€™s team role

recorded our voices and out it together with the slides the resource investigator had 
prepared.  
By the end of the project, I had noticed that the level of engagement show by the group 
members had increased as you understand more about people as individuals. It is relevant 
to understand otherâ€™s methods of performance and how they would like to be treated in 
order to get the most out of them. As Patricia Costa et al (2014) mention on their article, 
the amount of energy and enthusiasm of groups/teams are based on how they interact 
with others, which in my experience, as we all got along well, there was high levels of 
energy shown by everyone. I believe that members of our team were motivated by the fact 
that other had left, as if there was a hunger to show we could do it without them.  
Conclusion: 
As mentioned above, our group faced a lot of problems which we did not see coming, we 
were caught by surprise and we had to find ways to deal with them efficiently and with less 
disturbances as possible. Within the first 2 weeks, we had a problem with a person who 
did not seem to want to co operate with the rest of the group, which I believe we dealt with 
well as we tried to resolve any issues as soon as we realised. Our seminar tutor helped us 
solve the situation smoothly, and we managed to get past that. From around week 3 until 
the last few weeks, the group was fine, but another issue with another group member 
came up and we had to deal with that swell. I strongly believe that both issues had some 
say in how our project turned out, meaning, if these problems had not manifested 
themselves, I believe we were on course to getting a much better mark than we ended 
with.  
I personally feel like I dealt with the situation as you would expect a team worker would, 
trying to look for positives in situations and attempting to defuse any arguments or 
confrontations. I helped on any tasks I possibly could while also taking care of my own 
ones.  
I feel like we worked well as a team where possible, and despite the fact that we were from 
very multicultural backgrounds, we dealt with diversity well and any communication 
barriers were deal with efficiently.  
I believe that our methods of communication were well chosen and well used, however 
there are  few tings we could have done better. We could have maybe started the process 
earlier in order to make sure we had more time to go over certain aspects. Our choice of 
social media could have been a more efficient one as we used Instagram, but a more 
useful tool could have been WhatsApp for example.  
In terms of team selection, we did not do much wrong as we used the Belbin theory test to 
decide who we would be in a team with.
